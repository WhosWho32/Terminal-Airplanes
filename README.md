# Terminal-Airplanes
A terminal-based variation of the Battleships game, written in C++, where you play against a bot.

You also have access to various commands upon entering a special code, such as being able to view every enemy airplane's position on the board or completely anihilate it.
If you wish to play this with sound, it is recommended that you run the actual .exe instead of running it inside VSCode.

Have fun!

If you're using VSCode, use the following command to compile the program:

```
g++ -o airplanes.exe bot.cpp definitions.cpp game.cpp main.cpp
```

And to run the program:
```
./airplanes.exe
```
